Here's an example:

```js
heapsPermute([1, 2, 3], function(input){console.log(input);});
```

prints:

<pre>
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
[ 2, 1, 3 ]
[ 3, 1, 2 ]
[ 1, 3, 2 ]
[ 2, 3, 1 ]
[ 3, 2, 1 ]
</pre>

The first argument to `heapsPermute` should be an `array` of values to permute. The second argument, `output`, gets invoked on each unique value. The third argument is an internal counter â€” don't use it when you call the function.

This algorithm runs in factorial time, and takes quite a while if you run it with an array longer than 10 items. For example, n = 7 took my computer about 1 second; n = 8 took around 7 seconds; n = 9 took over a minute to print the [362880 different permutations](https://www.google.com/search?q=9!).
